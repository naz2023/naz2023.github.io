<h1>Naz CANDAL</h1>
<p>Welcome to my GitHub repository page with the Web Basics for the first project.</p> 
<p>I am happy to learn the basics of the GitHub community and my objective is updating this repository regularly through the semester.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>My favorite hobby is trekking, I always find it very interesting to discover new places and observe the nature from different perspectives. My other hobby is scuba diving, it is also another challenging activity for experiencing different places around the world. I believe that my hobbies are beneficial for improving my productivity and social skills.</p>

<h2>Digital Design</h2>
<p>Recently, I have been using different digital tools for my personal and academic life. I have noticed that each tool has improved my understanding about the integration of online and offline fields in today's modern world. Digital tools, such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, are useful for combining written content and visual details. For instance, creating brochures, designing news websites and making infographics could increase the impact of written text.</p>

<p>These are the digital design tools that I have some experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photoshop</li>
<li>Illustrator</li>
<li>InDesign</li>
</ul>

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>Moreover, I also like studying art history. I believe that art history enhances our understanding between past and future from the art perspective. It also builds important connections between abstract and concrete concepts. Building creative approach could be useful for having better imagination in real life.</p>
